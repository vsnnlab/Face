### 1. System requirements
- MATLAB 2019b or later version
- Installation of the Deep Learning Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- Installation of the pretrained AlexNet (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network)
- No non-standard hardware is required.
- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2019b.

### 2. Installation
- Download all files and folders. ("Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP")
- Download 'AlexNet_2018b.mat', 'PretrainedNet.zip', 'Stimulus.zip' and unzip files in the same directory
  - AlexNet_2018b.mat (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1eaHaVttd_Y1dDcuph9F8N9s7OwdUvC/view?usp=sharing)
  - PretrainedNet.zip (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBl-2QsOHb1VMd20NYmPm_jWx4i2Cwul/view?usp=sharing)
  - Stimulus.zip (https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vFQsDF2Cl6nwDuHzR7ZRFIzcQFqnRrd/view?usp=sharing) 
- Expected Installation time is about 45 minutes, but may vary by system conditions.
 
### 3. Instructions for demo
- Run "Main.m" and select figure numbers (from 1 to 6) that you want to perform a demo simulation.
- Expected running time is about 5 minutes for each figure, but may vary by system conditions.

### 4. Expected output for demo
- Below results for untrained AlexNet will be shown.
  1) Spontaneous emergence of face-selectivity in untrained networks (Figure 1b-g)
  2) Preferred feature images of face-selective units in untrained networks (Figure 2b,d) 
  3) Detection of face images using the response of face units in untrained networks (Figure 3b-d) 
  4) Invariant characteristics of face-selective units in untrained networks  (Figure 4a-f) 
  5) Invariant characteristics of face-selective units in untrained networks  (Figure 5a,f-h) 
  6) Effect of training on face-selectivity in untrained networks  (Figure 6b-d)
