### 1. System requirements
- MATLAB 2019b or later version
- Installation of the Deep Learning Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- Installation of the pretrained AlexNet (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network)
- No non-standard hardware is required.
- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2019b.

### 2. Installation
- Download all files and folders. ("Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP")
- Download 'Data.zip', 'Stimulus.zip' from below link and unzip files in the same directory
- [Data URL] : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5637812
- Expected Installation time is about 45 minutes, but may vary by system conditions.
 
### 3. Instructions for demo
- Run "Main.m" and select result numbers (from 1 to 6) that you want to perform a demo simulation.
- Expected running time is about 5 minutes for each figure, but may vary by system conditions.

### 4. Expected output for demo
- Below results for untrained AlexNet will be shown.
  - Result 1) Run_Unit: Spontaneous emergence of face-selectivity in untrained networks (Fig.1, Fig.S1-3)
  - Result 2) Run_PFI: Preferred feature images of face-selective units in untrained networks (Fig.2, Fig.S4) 
  - Result 3) Run_SVM: Detection of face images using the response of face units in untrained networks (Fig.3, Fig.S11-12)  
  - Result 4) Run_Trained: Effect of training on face-selectivity in untrained networks (Fig.4) 
  - Result 5) Run_Invariance: Invariant characteristics of face-selective units in untrained networks (Fig.S5) 
  - Result 6) Run_View: Viewpoint invariance of face-selective units in untrained networks (Fig.S8)
