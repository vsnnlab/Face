### 1. System requirements
- MATLAB 2018b or later version
- Installation of the Deep Learning Toolbox (https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- Installation of the pretrained AlexNet (https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59133-deep-learning-toolbox-model-for-alexnet-network)
- No non-standard hardware is required.
- Uploaded codes were tested using MATLAB 2018b and 2019b.

### 2. Installation
- Download all files and folders. ("Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP")
- Download "Dataset_subset1.zip"~"Dataset_subset6.zip" and merge in a file named as 'Dataset' in the same directory 

### 3. Instructions for demo
- Run "Run.mlapp" and select figure numbers (from 1 to 4) that you want to perform a demo simulation.
- Expected running time is about 5 minutes for each figure, but may vary by system conditions.
